# Memory Streams 

This example shows how to change any Papillon object help in memory into a blob of characters.

This blob can then be saved in a store, such as a redis cache, a blob in a database or on file disk.

At a later stage the original Papillon object can then be reconstructed from this blob.

This is done using the [PMemoryStream](https://videoai.net/papillon/classpapillon_1_1_p_memory_stream.html).
